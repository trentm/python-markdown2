Markdown is a light text markup format and a processor to convert that to HTML.
The originator describes it as follows:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
> Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, 
> easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to 
> structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

This is a fast and complete Python implementation of Markdown. It was written to
closely match the behaviour of the original Perl-implemented Markdown.pl. There
is another [Python
markdown.py](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/). However, at
least at the time this project was started, markdown2.py was faster (see the
[Performance
Notes](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Performance-Notes)) and,
to my knowledge, more correct (see [Testing
Notes](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Testing-Notes)).
That was a while ago though, so you should still consider Python-markdown for
your usage.


# Install

To install it in your Python installation run *one* of the following:

    pypm install markdown2      # if you use ActivePython (activestate.com/activepython)
    pip install markdown2
    python setup.py install

However, everything you need to run this is in "lib/markdown2.py". If it is
easier for you, you can just copy that file to somewhere on your PythonPath
(to use as a module) or executable path (to use as a script).


# Quick Usage

As a module:

    >>> import markdown2
    >>> markdown2.markdown("*boo!*")  # or use `html = markdown_path(PATH)`
    u'<p><em>boo!</em></p>\n'

    >>> markdowner = Markdown()
    >>> markdowner.convert("*boo!*")
    u'<p><em>boo!</em></p>\n'
    >>> markdowner.convert("**boom!**")
    u'<p><strong>boom!</strong></p>\n'

As a script:

    $ python markdown2.py foo.md > foo.html

Via the command line:

    $ markdown2 foo.md > foo.html

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki),
[lib/markdown2.py](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/blob/master/lib/markdown2.py)
docstrings and/or `python markdown2.py --help` for more details.

# Extra Syntax (aka extensions)

Many Markdown processors include support for additional optional syntax
(often called "extensions") and markdown2 is no exception. With markdown2 these
are called "extras".  Using the "footnotes" extra as an example, here is how
you use an extra ... as a module:

    $ python markdown2.py --extras footnotes foo.md > foo.html

as a script:

    >>> import markdown2
    >>> markdown2.markdown("*boo!*", extras=["footnotes"])
    u'<p><em>boo!</em></p>\n'

There are a number of currently implemented extras for tables, footnotes,
syntax coloring of `<pre>`-blocks, auto-linking patterns, table of contents,
Smarty Pants (for fancy quotes, dashes, etc.) and more. See the [Extras
wiki page](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras) for full
details.


# Project

The python-markdown2 project lives at
<https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/>.  (Note: On Mar 6, 2011 this
project was moved from [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2)
to here on Github.) See also, [markdown2 on the Python Package Index
(PyPI)](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/markdown2).

# Test Suite

This markdown implementation passes a fairly extensive test suite. To run it:

    cd test && python test.py

If you have the [mk](https://github.com/ActiveState/mk) tool installed you can
run the test suite with all available Python versions by running:

    mk test

The crux of the test suite is a number of "cases" directories -- each with a
set of matching .text (input) and .html (expected output) files. These are:

    tm-cases/                   Tests authored for python-markdown2 (tm=="Trent Mick")
    markdowntest-cases/         Tests from the 3rd-party MarkdownTest package
    php-markdown-cases/         Tests from the 3rd-party MDTest package
    php-markdown-extra-cases/   Tests also from MDTest package

See the [Testing Notes wiki
page](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Testing-Notes) for full
details.
